My 2014 Valentine's Day present to my wife.

## No Tooling, Yet

As of Feb 2014, Joni is still learning HTML/CSS, Sass, and a million other things. She is not focusing on tooling, specifically with JS. So no Bower, no Yeoman, no npm, no Grunt, at least not yet.

These things are noticeably absent from this project in an effort to make it easily accessible to her and anyone else that finds it.
